# Google_Account_Security_Not_Availible
No Account Security for Google Accounts so we can Bypass FRP when no other Security is Set


If we have a device that doesn't have any security, such as a PIN or Facelook Biometric Password for unlocking, we can access the Android device without any obstacles. 
This allows us to delete the Google account in the settings without Security Confirmations and thus bypass the FRP by logging into a new Google account.
